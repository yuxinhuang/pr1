What has been the place of literature in China in the modern era? What vision of modern China do we find in its literature? How, moreover, does literature subvert the national narrative? Through literature as a window on the history of modern China, students will gain a better understanding of Chinese history and culture with regard to its social reform, revolution, war, cultural revolution, cultural revival, and economic growth.</p></td>
